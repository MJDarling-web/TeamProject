# Urban Photography API
A RESTful web service for discovering, contributing to, and managing photography locations.  
Built with **Java**, **Hibernate**, **Jersey**, **JUnit**, and deployed to **AWS**.

---

## Problem Statement
Photography enthusiasts often struggle to discover and share ideal photography spots due to scattered information and the absence of a centralized platform.  
This project aims to address these challenges by creating an API that enables developers to find, contribute to, and manage a curated list of photography locations, including detailed information such as descriptions, images, and optimal shooting times.
